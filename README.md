# Homebridge Broadlink RM

Broadlink RM Mini and Pro plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

This allows you to control your RM Mini and Pro with HomeKit and Siri.

## IMPORTANT

- Requires Node.js >= 7.6.0
- If you're seeing something like "ERROR LOADING PLUGIN"..."async setCharacteristicValue (props, value, callback) {" then please check your node version before creating a new issue: `node -v`.

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `sudo npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-broadlink-rm`
3. Update your configuration file. (See config-sample.json)

## Overriding the homebridge directory (AKA where the consig.json file lives)
Generally the plugin can find where your config.json lives as it commonly sits in the .homebridge directory of your user account. If you're doing something out of the ordinary however you may need to override this. You can do so by adding a "homebridgeDirectory" key/value pair to the platform config.

## Broadlink RM Device Discovery

As of version 1.0.0 your Broadlink RM Device is automatically discovered so you no longer need to specify a "host" value.
If your network doesn't support automatic discovery then you can add a "hosts" array to the platform object (See config-sample.json).

## Learning Hex IR and RF codes

"Learn" and "Scan Frequency" accessories are automatically added to the Home app (so long as you've not added either manually in the config). Simply toggle the switch on, perform the IR or RF command in front of your Broadlink RM device and copy the HEX output from the homebridge console log to wherever you want the code in the config.

The switch will toggle off automatically once the code has been received. You can optionally stop attempting to learn a code by toggling the switch off yourself.

disableAutomaticOff (optional) | Prevent the learn-code accessory from turning off automatically after a given amount of time or when a hex code has been received. | false | true
scanFrequency (optional) | This changes the type of learning to be the same as the default "Scan Frequency" | true | false

### switch

Turn the switch on and the "on" hex code is sent, turn it off and the "off" hex code is sent.

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
disableAutomaticOff (optional) | Prevent the window-covering from turning off automatically after a given amount of time. | false | true

### window-covering

The window-covering accessory designed to be used by IR/RF controlled blinds/shades/shutters.

The accessory will calculate how many times the open and close hex code needs to be sent based on the existing % and requested %. In order to do this a "percentageChangePerSend" needs to be set. e.g. If it takes 10 sends of the code to open the covering then the value of "percentageChangePerSend" should be 10. If it takes 20 then it should be 5.

If you simply want to open or close the blinds with a single hex code then you could set "percentageChangePerSend" to 100 which will just sent the command once.

--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
data (required) | Hex data stored as a key-value JSON object. | See below. | -
totalDurationOpen (required) | The amount of time in seconds it takes to open the window-covering completely. | 45 | -

#### "data" key-value object

key | description
--- | -----------
open | A hex code string to be sent when the window-covering is requested to open.
close | A hex code string to be sent when the window-covering is requested to close.
stop | A hex code string to be sent when the window-covering is stopped automatically.


### air-conditioner

This allows you to send a hex code for any temperature that you've defined a hex code for. If you simply want to heat up or cool down a room (and not learn every single temperature code) you can just set hex codes for the lowest and highest temperatures and those will be used whatever temperature you request.

key | description | example | default

defaultHeatTemperature (optional) | The temperature that will be requested when no hex code exists for the specified temperature. | 28 | 30
heatTemperature (optional) | The temperature at which we change the UI to show that we're heating. Also used to determine whether "defaultCoolTemperature" or "defaultHeatTemperature" is used. | 20 | 22
replaceAutoMode (optional) | When we turn on the thermostat with Siri it sets the mode as "auto" which isn't  supported at this time so we set the mode to "cool" or "heat" instead depending on the value of this key. | "heat" | "cool"
pseudoDeviceTemperature (optional) | Some RM devices don't have a built in thermometer, when set this prevents the device thermometer from being accessed and shows the provided value instead. | 0 | 0
autoHeatTemperature (optional) | When the temperature is below this value, the heat mode will be enabled. | 18 | -
autoCoolTemperature (optional) | When the temperature is above this value, the cool mode will enabled. | 27 | -
autoMinimumDuration (optional) | The minimum amount of time in seconds that an auto mode should be turned on (or after being automatically turned off) for to prevent it from turning on/off too frequently. | 300 | 120
temperatureAdjustment (optional) | The number of degrees that the reported temperature should be offset by. | 3 | 0


#### "data" key-value object

key | description

data | Hex data stored as string.
pseudo-mode | The mode we set when this hex is sent. i.e. "heat" or "cool". For graphical purposes only (hence use of the term "pseudo").


## Air Conditioner Notes

There looks to be a glitch in the Apple Home app in that nothing happens when setting the mode to Off when you've turned the thermostat on by setting a specific temperature. Siri and other HomeKit apps don't have the same glitch. As a work-around you can just select a different mode and then press Off. This only happens the first time after launching homebridge.

Adding "autoHeatTemperature" and "autoCoolTemperature" can help automatically maintain a temperature. When the temperature falls below and hits above the "autoHeatTemperature" and "autoCoolTemperature" temperatures the accessory will automatically set the temperature to whatever the "defaultHeatTemperature" and "defaultCoolTemperature" is. The accessory will then keep checking (every "autoMinimumDuration" seconds) and if the temperature changes to be between the "autoHeatTemperature" and "autoCoolTemperature" temperatures then it will turn itself off. Something to note however is that if you decide to set a new temperature when the accessory has automatically turned itself on then it will still attempt to turn itself back off. To stop this automatic turn-off you can turn off the accessory manually and then turn it back on manually. Bare in mind that while the Home app may say 22C, the temperature may actually be 22.4C and if the Home app says 23C then it may actually be 22.5C.


## Multiple Broadlink RM Devices

If you have multiple devices (e.g. one in the bedroom, one in the lounge) then you  can additionally specify a `"host"` value with the Broadlink RM's IP or MAC address.

If you wish to have multiple Learn Code accessories (e.g. for each device) then you can add accessories with a type of `"learn-code"` and then specify the `"host"` and `"name"` values.
