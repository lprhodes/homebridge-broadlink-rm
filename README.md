# Homebridge Broadlink RM Enhanced

## Introduction
Welcome to the Broadlink RM Mini and Broadlink RM Pro plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

This is a fork of the [original plugin by Luke Rhodes] (https://github.com/lprhodes/homebridge-broadlink-rm) that allows you to control your RM Mini and RM Pro with HomeKit using the Home app and Siri.

### About this fork
I am working on upgrades to the accessory specifications in this repository. For starters I am focused on fan, air-conditioners and heater accessories to help improve the user experience of the devices like portable ACs, Lasko tower fans and tower heaters, etc.

I eventually would like to add multiple contibuters who can review and integrate PRs so more people can collectively extend the accessories.

If you want to use this fork, use this command:

`npm i -g homebridge-broadlink-rm-enhanced`

This plugin can be used in conjunction with other forks of Broadlink RM plugin. This enables one to use this plugin for some accessories while other plugin for other accessories with the same Broadlink IR Blaster.

Add under the data section of the fan accessory in config.json as shown in the config-sample.json
| key | description | example | default |
|--|--|--|--|
| stepSize | Increments of fan speed. This will update Home app UI so that fan speed increases in steps. If your fan support 4 speeds and the step size should be 100/4 = 25. | 25 | 1 |

##### Combined fan speed and swing modes
Some fans (e.g. Lasko tower fan) with remotes that have a display, generate unique hex codes for a combination of each speed and swing mode. If you have such a device, you can record each hex code in the config.json as shown below.

config.json
```
{
	"name": "fan", // choose name of your choice
	"type": "fan",
	"swingOn": "on", // this has to be "on"
	"swingOff": "off", // this has to be "off"
	"data": {
		"fanSpeed50": {
			"swingOn": "26008a002828123f282a...", // replace with hex codes to turn on swing at the corresponding speed
			"swingOff": "26008a002828123f282a..." // replace with hex codes to turn off swing at the corresponding speed
		}
	}
}
```

#### Heater Cooler Accessory
Implementation of heater cooler accessory specification as per Apple HAP. Heater cooler allows for better representation of standalone heaters and air-conditioners that support functions like 
oscillation and fan speed.

In addition to the fan speed and oscillation features, this accessory also supports temperature in both degree Celsius and Fahrenheit.
