# Homebridge Broadlink RM Community

## Introduction
Welcome to the Broadlink RM Mini and Broadlink RM Pro plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

This is a fork of the [original plugin by Luke Rhodes] (https://github.com/lprhodes/homebridge-broadlink-rm) that allows you to control your RM Mini and RM Pro with HomeKit using the Home app and Siri.

### About this fork
I am working on upgrades to the accessory specifications in this repository. For starters I am focused on fan, air-conditioners and heater accessories to help improve the user experience of the devices like portable ACs, Lasko tower fans and tower heaters, etc.

I eventually would like to add multiple contibuters who can review and integrate PRs hence the "community" tag here so more people can collectively extend the accessories.

If you want to use this fork, use this command:

`npm i -g homebridge-broadlink-rm-community`

## Like this plugin?
